# Week 4
## Learning Activities & Resources
As last week I used Docker to locally host my WordPress site I used the Varying Vagrant Vagrants(VVV) extension of Vagrant. It required a fair bit more setup compared to Docker as not only did I need Vagrant I also needed Virtual Box. Other than that to me they seem similar just that Docker is an all in one solution and a bit more simpler to get up a running and is lot more popular nowadays.  
[Installation | VVV](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/docs/en-US/installation/)  
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)  
[Duplicator](https://duplicator.com/)  
## Estimated Hours

## Content Insights
I used the Duplicator plugin to copy my WordPress site from Docker to VVV, it was very easy to use although I did run into a problem when exporting it to VVV hosted site. In that the DB name, username and a few other names were different, I found that I needed to go into the wp-config file of the new site and use those DB name, username etc to complete the transfer.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Containerization and Virtual Machines are a big part of software development, being able to create web sites and apps and easily share them with all their configurations to ensure they work on any machine can greatly speed up development time. The ability to also have a local copy of the software to be able to make changes without affecting the live site/app is another boon. Although Docker is way more prevalent in development industry virtual machines still have a use and having experience in both is good to have when looking for a career
