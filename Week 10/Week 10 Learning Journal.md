## Content Insights
Practice is essential to have a good presentation, it allows you to have better flow and shows weak points in the script. Some words or sentences can be difficult to say out loud, practicing allows me to find these and either practice or change the script. The timing also needed to be kept in check as there was a 10 minute limit and we needed to have enough time to present all the parts. Overall the script did not change drastically and was more of a refinement over the previous ones and making sure eye contact was being made and I wasn't reading entirely off the script.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Soft skills are an important skill to have for any job and job interview. Improving my soft skills is especially important now that I am nearing the end of my degree and will need to do interviews for jobs. Public speaking and clear pronunciation are something I know I'm not good at and practicing helps me be more confident. This presentation highlights that I need to practice for job interviews so I can confidently showcase my skill set, I will also try and find some resources online to help with this.
