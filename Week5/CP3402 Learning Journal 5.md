# Week 5
## Learning Activities & Resources
I had already created a child theme last week for the assignment so it was fairly simple to do. As I used it for a site hosted in docker the way to add it into the site is a bit different as you mount the folder in the docker-compose file. This adds the benefit that you can easily edit it using a code editor I used VScode and the site will update after a refresh making changes super simple.

## Content Insights
I made some basic changes so that the content wouldn't be changed too much when applying the theme making it easy to change. The changes I made were background colour, text colour, change fonts, made images and some containers have rounded corners and made the text larger. These changes do not affect the site making it an easy swap without having to edit the site. 
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
LinkedIn almost seems like a must for professionals, it has many great features like being an online resume, searching for jobs or recruiters finding you, keeping connections and many more. Although I do dislike the social part of it, a lot of it feels very fake almost a toxic positivity but luckily that part is not as crucial compared to the other features.
