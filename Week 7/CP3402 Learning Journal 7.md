# Week 7

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week's practical was to write PHP and demonstrate some of the features. I used the advice shop repo and created two pages, a proper login page and a page to show services. 
I watched the “Introducing PHP” videos on LinkedIn to get a quick introduction before starting the practical.<br>

## Estimated Hours
About 2 hours
## Content Insights
Using PHP is interesting to me as it can start out as a HTML file and then PHP code can be added to enhance the website to give it more functions and usability. 
It can also be written separately without HTML and it will not be an accessible page on the website, this way the PHP is more like a function that can be called to any other page using ‘include(“somePage.php”);’. 
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Knowing PHP is essential for backend web developers as it handles server side logic and is used to create dynamic content on websites. 
I enjoyed using PHP and would consider using it for a site I want to make. I think using WordPress would be excessive as it will only be a simple site that at most would only have two or three pages.
