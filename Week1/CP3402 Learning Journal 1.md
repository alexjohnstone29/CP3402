# Week 1
## Learning Activities & Resources
For the website this week I chose to use Tailwind CSS, it is a framework for CSS where most of the CSS is written in the HTML file within the classes for each tag. This allows for fast styling and creation for websites in my limited experience.

## Estimated Hours
5hrs 
## Content Insights
While Tailwind is just a framework of CSS there is still a learning curve that I needed to understand thankfully the docs for Tailwind are very easy to understand with a lot of visuals to show as well. Going forward this would be my preferred way to use CSS when making websites.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
As Tailwind is not an actual language like Java or Python, there are no jobs that require specific knowledge in it but many job listings I see do list proficiency in frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap. I enjoyed using Tailwind it allowed me to quickly create the website and the ability to add the CSS directly to the class for each tag made a lot of sense to me rather than the traditional separate file for CSS.
