# Week 3  

## Learning Activities & Resources
The block editor in WordPress was a lot easier to work compared to Joomla. Still I added a bootstrap extension as I preferred to use bootstrap to quickly create the web pages. I hosted the website locally using docker, I have a bit of familiarity with docker to create containers for some applications. Docker has an example docker-compose.yaml folder which I used. I added a title and also a locally hosted styles.css file as I learned from Joomla that having a locally available style.css is a lot quicker to add or change CSS it also updated instantly on the webpage making it really convenient.

The video helped as I wanted to create a child theme so that if the main theme updated my changes would not be removed.

## Content Insights
I see the difference between WordPress and Joomla and how the workflow is expected to work. At this stage I prefer WordPress as its a bit more user friendly. The bootstrap extension greatly sped up development, I was able to recreate the website in half the time compared to Joomla, although there may be a similar extension in Joomla. 
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
As web developers are mostly not limited to just one method of developing websites, its good to get experience in multiple methods. Even with these different methods the fundamentals of HTML and CSS are present and in both Joomla and WordPress I needed to do a bit of HTML and CSS to get things just the way I wanted. Also having experience with these opens you up to more jobs.
