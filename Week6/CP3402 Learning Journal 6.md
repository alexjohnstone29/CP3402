# Week 6
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week was about group setup for the second assignment <br>
I used [Underscores | A Starter Theme for WordPress](https://underscores.me/) to create an almost blank starter theme and [WordPress/theme-test-data: Theme Test Data](https://github.com/WordPress/theme-test-data) to generate the test data for the theme to work on
## Estimated Hours
2hr
## Content Insights
My contribution to the group setup was integrating GitHub into the slack channel and adding the starter theme and unit test data to the GitHub repo. I was initially confused about where to get the theme from as I was searching within the WordPress theme store but underscores is not on the theme store and is on its own website.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This assignment should give a good insight into how development works at a company, with people that have different skills and proficiencies, coming together to work on a project.
