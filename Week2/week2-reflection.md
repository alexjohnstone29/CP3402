## Learning Activities & Resources
Joomla has bootstrap built in and was the majority of how I created the website. Last week we had the opportunity to use bootstrap, which would have helped this week but I also gained experience using tailwind instead. 
[WordPress: An introduction | LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-5-essential-training/wordpress-an-introduction?u=2223545)
Watching the WordPress introduction video felt a bit irrelevant as this week was using Joomla and they have different philosophy's around how they are used to create websites. 
[Examples Â· Bootstrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/)
I made heavy use of the examples page on bootstrap to create my website.
[Virtual Private Server And Web Hosting - Amazon Lightsail - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/)
I used LightSail to host the website its fairly cheap at $5 USD a month. 
## Estimated Hours

## Content Insights
I really struggled working with Joomla, I found it very unintuitive to work through. I had just finished watching the WordPress video and went in to create the Joomla website thinking they would be similar but I found it to be very different. Most of my workflow was writing the main "article" in a local test file entirely out of bootstrap and html then adding that via the code input in Joomla. I'm not sure this is the right way to do it but it was the only way I could wrap my head around working with Joomla. 
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I will need to find a similar video to the WordPress one for Joomla as I struggled with it a lot. As expected there aren't specific jobs for Joomla, though most of the listings that come up are PHP developers as it is written mostly in PHP.
