Initially I tried to use Gulp but I ran into a lot of problems trying to get it to work, then I tried Grunt in the same directory and it worked right away. Using Sass to me is a very similar concept to themes in WordPress, in which you create a base theme and apply it to the website. I also like the introduction of variables. It makes writing CSS a lot easier as I don't need to remember the values for colours, I can just put $primary-color which is a lot easier to remember than a hex or rgb code. Mixins are another great feature that lets you create almost class-like structures with changeable variables, an example I used in my code was for two buttons they both used the same mixin but I could easily change the colour.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Sass features such as mixins, variables and extend make writing CSS much easier and organized and incorporate the DRY mentality. Automated build tools like Gulp and Grunt speed up development and are used not only in web development but across nearly all software development jobs, getting hands on experience with these tools will help when working in a development job.
